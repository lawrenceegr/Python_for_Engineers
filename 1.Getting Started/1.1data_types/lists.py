#list are the most flexible data type
#items in a list can be changed later in the program i.e they are flexible
#items in a list need not be of the same data type and are comma-separated
#example of a list in python
list = ['a','b','c','d']
print(list[2])
print("The number of items in this list = " + str(len(list)))#counting the number of items in list

print(list *2)#repeating the items in a list and printing them out
