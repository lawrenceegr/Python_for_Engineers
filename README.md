# 1. INTRODUCTION
I created this folder to document my python(for ML) 1-year learning journey.
## What to Learn
>> :warning: To avoid vialating the copyright of the reference book(mastering-machine-learning-with-python-in-six-steps),the course content are as per the author of the reference book.
#### Chapter 1, Step 1 - Getting started in Python. 
    This chapter will help you to set up the
    environment, and introduce you to the key concepts of Python programming language
    in relevance to machine learning. If you are already well versed with Python basics, I
    recommend you glance through the chapter quickly and move onto the next chapter.
#### Chapter 2, Step 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning. 
    Here you will learn about the
    history, evolution, and different frameworks in practice for building machine learning
    systems. I think this understanding is very important as it will give you a broader
    perspective and set the stage for your further expedition. You’ll understand the different
    types of machine learning (supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement learning). You
    will also learn the various concepts are involved in core data analysis packages (NumPy,
    Pandas, Matplotlib) with example codes.
#### Chapter 3, Step 3 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning 
    This chapter will expose you to various fundamental concepts involved in feature engineering, supervised learning
    (linear regression, nonlinear regression, logistic regression, time series forecasting and
    classification algorithms), unsupervised learning (clustering techniques, dimension
    reduction technique) with the help of scikit-learn and statsmodel packages.
#### Chapter 4, Step 4 - Model Diagnosis and Tuning.
    in this chapter you’ll learn advanced
    topics around different model diagnosis, which covers the common problems that arise,
    and various tuning techniques to overcome these issues to build efficient models. The
    topics include choosing the correct probability cutoff, handling an imbalanced dataset,
    the variance, and the bias issues. You’ll also learn various tuning techniques such as
    ensemble models and hyperparameter tuning using grid / random search.■ IntroduCtIon

#### Chapter 5, Step 5 - Text Mining and Recommender System.
    Statistics says 70% of the data available in the business world is in the form of text, so text mining has vast scope across various domains. You will learn the building blocks and basic concepts to advanced NLP techniques. You’ll also learn the recommender systems that are most commonly used to create personalization for customers.
    #### Chapter 6,Step 6 - Deep and Reinforcement Learning. 
    There has been a great advancement in the area of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) through deep learning
    techniques and it has been the buzzword in recent times. You’ll learn various aspects of deep learning such as multilayer perceptrons, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, RN (Recurrent Neural Network) for text classification, and transfer learning. And you’ll also learn the q-learning example to understand the concept of reinforcement learning.
